:wave: Hi, I'm Jenny-Lee, a french front-end software and web developer!

I work with Vue.js to build your web projects, associated with Electron if you want to create all-OS applications.

If you're interested by my work and expertise for one of your projects, please do not hesitate to contact me on [Malt](https://www.malt.fr/profile/jennyleeboulanger). I'm available to work on full remote from Strasbourg, France.
